                    <p>The Mexican redleg or red-legged tarantula (Brachypelma emilia 
                    or Euathlus emilia) is a species of terrestrial tarantula closely
                    related to the famous mexican redknee tarantula. 
                    Like the redknee it is a docile tarantula and popular in 
                    the pet trade. It is slow growing and, like many tarantulas, 
                    females can live for decades.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Size</h4>
                    <p>An adult female has a body roughly 4 inches (10 cm) long, with 
                    a legspan of 6 inches (15 cm), and a weight of approximately 15 to 16 grams.</p>
                    <h4>Venom</h4>

                <h2>Poecilotheria Metallica</h2>
                <article>
                    <img src="./img/poecilotheria-metallica.jpg" alt="Poecilotheria metallica">
                    <p>Poecilotheria metallica is an Old World species of tarantula. 
                    It reflects brilliant metallic blue color. 
                    Like others in its genus it exhibits an intricate fractal-like 
                    pattern on the abdomen. The species' natural habitat is deciduous 
                    forest in Andhra Pradesh, in central southern India.</p>
                    <h4>Size</h4>
                    <p>When full size, P. metallica's leg span is 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm).</p>
                    <h4>Venom</h4>
                    <p>There has never been a recorded human death from its bite. 
                    However, P. metallica's bite is considered medically significant, 
                    with venom that may cause intense pain, 
                    judging from the experience of keepers bitten by other spiders
                    from the genus.The vast majority are "dry bites," where no venom
                    is injected into the handler. The mechanical effects of the 
                    bite can still be worrisome, as an adults fangs can reach 
                    nearly 3/4 of an inch in length. P. metallica can move rapidly
                    and may defend itself when cornered. Venom may produce 
                    a heart-rate increase followed by sweating, headache, stinging, 
                    cramping, or swelling. Effects can last for up to a week.</p>
